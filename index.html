    <h3>Open Source Tools - Research Group</h3>
	  <p>Open science requires that knowledge will be made accessible to everyone. Open source software (FOSS) can generate software that fully satisfy the requirements of different user types. Also, it allows  the scientists maintain control of their research processes, compatible with the ethos of academic autonomy that is proper to researchers.</p>

<p>Our research group on Open Science Tools want to provide software and specifications useful to researchers of different disciplines. Our team includes specialists from Psychology, Economics, Biodiversity, Software Engineering and Communication, in order to provide a broad and comprehensive vision of the needs of the scientific community.</p>

<p>Our main project is <strong><a href='http://www.buhos.org'>Buhos</a></strong>, an application for managing the complete process of systematic literature reviews. It is web-based and developed in Ruby.  We are working towards extending its features, to make it a complete solution for different types of literature reviews and meta-analysis. Also, we need help to improve the user experience of the application.
